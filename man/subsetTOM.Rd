\title{Topological overlap for a subset of a whole set of genes}
\usage{
subsetTOM(datExpr, subset, corFnc = "cor", corOptions = "use = 'p'",
  networkType = "unsigned", power = 6, verbose = 1, indent = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{datExpr}{a data frame containing the expression data of the whole set,
with rows corresponding to samples and columns to genes.}

\item{subset}{a single logical or numeric vector giving the indices of the
nodes for which the TOM is to be calculated.}

\item{corFnc}{character string giving the correlation function to be used
for the adjacency calculation. Recommended choices are \code{"cor"} and
\code{"bicor"}, but other functions can be used as well.}

\item{corOptions}{character string giving further options to be passed to
the correlation function.}

\item{networkType}{character string giving network type. Allowed values are
(unique abbreviations of) \code{"unsigned"}, \code{"signed"}, \code{"signed
hybrid"}. See \code{\link{adjacency}}.}

\item{power}{soft-thresholding power for network construction.}

\item{verbose}{integer level of verbosity. Zero means silent, higher values
make the output progressively more and more verbose.}

\item{indent}{indentation for diagnostic messages. Zero means no
indentation, each unit adds two spaces.}
}
\value{
A matrix of dimensions \code{n*n}, where \code{n} is the number of
entries selected by \code{block}.
}
\description{
This function calculates topological overlap of a subset of vectors with
respect to a whole data set.
}
\details{
This function is designed to calculated topological overlaps of small
subsets of large expression data sets, for example in individual modules.
