\title{Calculates connectivity of a weighted network.}
\usage{
softConnectivity.fromSimilarity(similarity, type = "unsigned", power = if
  (type == "signed") 15 else 6, blockSize = 1500, verbose = 2, indent = 0)

softConnectivity(datExpr, corFnc = "cor", corOptions = "use = 'p'",
  type = "unsigned", power = if (type == "signed") 15 else 6,
  blockSize = 1500, minNSamples = NULL, verbose = 2, indent = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{similarity}{a similarity matrix: a square symmetric matrix with
entries between -1 and 1.}

\item{type}{network type. Allowed values are (unique abbreviations of)
\code{"unsigned"}, \code{"signed"}, \code{"signed hybrid"}.}

\item{power}{soft thresholding power.}

\item{blockSize}{block size in which adjacency is to be calculated. Too low
(say below 100) may make the calculation inefficient, while too high may
cause R to run out of physical memory and slow down the computer. Should be
chosen such that an array of doubles of size (number of genes) * (block
size) fits into available physical memory.}

\item{verbose}{integer level of verbosity. Zero means silent, higher values
make the output progressively more and more verbose.}

\item{indent}{indentation for diagnostic messages. Zero means no
indentation, each unit adds two spaces.}

\item{datExpr}{a data frame containing the expression data, with rows
corresponding to samples and columns to genes.}

\item{corFnc}{character string giving the correlation function to be used
for the adjacency calculation. Recommended choices are \code{"cor"} and
\code{"bicor"}, but other functions can be used as well.}

\item{corOptions}{character string giving further options to be passed to
the correlation function.}

\item{minNSamples}{minimum number of samples available for the calculation
of adjacency for the adjacency to be considered valid.  If not given,
defaults to the greater of \code{..minNSamples} (currently 4) and number of
samples divided by 3.  If the number of samples falls below this threshold,
the connectivity of the corresponding gene will be returned as \code{NA}.}
}
\value{
A vector with one entry per gene giving the connectivity of each
gene in the weighted network.
}
\description{
Given expression data or a similarity, the function constructs the adjacency
matrix and for each node calculates its connectivity, that is the sum of the
adjacency to the other nodes.
