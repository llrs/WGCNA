\usage{
verboseScatterplot(x, y, sample = NULL, corFnc = "cor",
  corOptions = "use = 'p'", main = "", xlab = NA, ylab = NA, cex = 1,
  cex.axis = 1.5, cex.lab = 1.5, cex.main = 1.5, abline = FALSE,
  abline.color = 1, abline.lty = 1, corLabel = corFnc,
  displayAsZero = 1e-05, col = 1, bg = 0, lmFnc = lm, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numerical vector to be plotted along the x axis.}

\item{y}{numerical vector to be plotted along the y axis.}

\item{sample}{determines whether \code{x} and \code{y} should be sampled for
plotting, useful to keep the plot manageable when \code{x} and \code{y} are
large vectors. The default \code{NULL} value implies no sampling. A single
numeric value will be interpreted as the number of points to sample
randomly. If a vector is given, it will be interpreted as the indices of the
entries in \code{x} and \code{y} that should be plotted. In either case, the
correlation and p value will be determined from the full vectors \code{x}
and \code{y}.}

\item{corFnc}{character string giving the correlation function to annotate
the plot.}

\item{corOptions}{character string giving further options to the correlation
function.}

\item{main}{main title for the plot.}

\item{xlab}{label for the x-axis.}

\item{ylab}{label for the y-axis.}

\item{cex}{character expansion factor for plot annotations.}

\item{cex.axis}{character expansion factor for axis annotations.}

\item{cex.lab}{character expansion factor for axis labels.}

\item{cex.main}{character expansion factor for the main title.}

\item{abline}{logical: should the linear regression fit line be plotted?}

\item{abline.color}{color specification for the fit line.}

\item{abline.lty}{line type for the fit line.}

\item{corLabel}{character string to be used as the label for the correlation
value printed in the main title.}

\item{displayAsZero}{Correlations whose absolute value is smaller than this
number will be displayed as zero. This can result in a more intuitive
display (for example, cor=0 instead of cor=2.6e-17).}

\item{col}{color of the plotted symbols. Recycled as necessary.}

\item{bg}{fill color of the plotted symbols (used for certain symbols).
Recycled as necessary.}

\item{lmFnc}{linear model fit function. Used to calculate the linear model
fit line if \code{'abline'} is \code{TRUE}. For example, robust linear
models are implemented in the function \code{\link[MASS]{rlm}}.}

\item{\dots}{other arguments to the function \code{\link{plot}}.}
}
\value{
If \code{sample} above is given, the indices of the plotted points
are returned invisibly.
}
\description{
Produce a scatterplot annotated by the correlation, p-value, and regression
line.
}
\details{
Irrespective of the specified correlation function, the p-value is always
calculated for pearson correlation.
