\title{Iterative filtering of samples and genes with too many missing entries}
\usage{
goodSamplesGenes(datExpr, minFraction = 1/2, minNSamples = ..minNSamples,
  minNGenes = ..minNGenes, tol = NULL, verbose = 1, indent = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{datExpr}{expression data. A data frame in which columns are genes and
rows ar samples.}

\item{minFraction}{minimum fraction of non-missing samples for a gene to be
considered good.}

\item{minNSamples}{minimum number of non-missing samples for a gene to be
considered good.}

\item{minNGenes}{minimum number of good genes for the data set to be
considered fit for analysis. If the actual number of good genes falls below
this threshold, an error will be issued.}

\item{tol}{an optional 'small' number to compare the variance against.
Defaults to the square of \code{1e-10 * max(abs(datExpr), na.rm = TRUE)}.
The reason of comparing the variance to this number, rather than zero, is
that the fast way of computing variance used by this function sometimes
causes small numerical overflow errors which make variance of constant
vectors slightly non-zero; comparing the variance to \code{tol} rather than
zero prevents the retaining of such genes as 'good genes'.}

\item{verbose}{integer level of verbosity. Zero means silent, higher values
make the output progressively more and more verbose.}

\item{indent}{indentation for diagnostic messages. Zero means no
indentation, each unit adds two spaces.}
}
\value{
A list with the foolowing components: \item{goodSamples}{ A logical vector
with one entry per sample that is \code{TRUE} if the sample is considered
good and \code{FALSE} otherwise.  }

\item{goodGenes}{ A logical vector with one entry per gene that is
\code{TRUE} if the gene is considered good and \code{FALSE} otherwise.  }
}
\description{
This function checks data for missing entries and zero-variance genes, and
returns a list of samples and genes that pass criteria maximum number of
missing values. If necessary, the filtering is iterated.
}
\details{
This function iteratively identifies samples and genes with too many missing
entries and genes with zero variance. Iterations may be required since
excluding samples effectively changes criteria on genes and vice versa. The
process is repeated until the lists of good samples and genes are stable.
The constants \code{..minNSamples} and \code{..minNGenes} are both set to
the value 4.
