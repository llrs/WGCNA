\usage{
pickSoftThreshold.fromSimilarity(similarity, ...)

pickSoftThreshold(data, dataIsExpr = TRUE, RsquaredCut = 0.85,
  powerVector = c(seq(1, 10, by = 1), seq(12, 20, by = 2)),
  removeFirst = FALSE, nBreaks = 10, blockSize = NULL, corFnc = cor,
  corOptions = list(use = "p"), networkType = "unsigned",
  moreNetworkConcepts = FALSE, verbose = 0, indent = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{similarity}{Matrix whose values are between -1 and 1}

\item{...}{Other arguments from pickSoftThreshold}

\item{data}{expression data in a matrix or data frame. Rows correspond to
samples and columns to genes.}

\item{dataIsExpr}{logical: should the data be interpreted as expression (or
other numeric) data, or as a similarity matrix of network nodes?}

\item{RsquaredCut}{desired minimum scale free topology fitting index
\eqn{R^2}.}

\item{powerVector}{a vector of soft thresholding powers for which the scale
free topology fit indices are to be calculated.}

\item{removeFirst}{should the first bin be removed from the connectivity
histogram?}

\item{nBreaks}{number of bins in connectivity histograms}

\item{blockSize}{block size into which the calculation of connectivity
should be broken up. If not given, a suitable value will be calculated using
function \code{blockSize} and printed if \code{verbose>0}. If R runs into
memory problems, decrease this value.}

\item{corFnc}{the correlation function to be used in adjacency calculation.}

\item{corOptions}{a list giving further options to the correlation function
specified in \code{corFnc}.}

\item{networkType}{network type. Allowed values are (unique abbreviations
of) \code{"unsigned"}, \code{"signed"}, \code{"signed hybrid"}. See
\code{\link{adjacency}}.}

\item{moreNetworkConcepts}{logical: should additional network concepts be
calculated? If \code{TRUE}, the function will calculate how the network
density, the network heterogeneity, and the network centralization depend on
the power. For the definition of these additional network concepts, see
Horvath and Dong (2008). PloS Comp Biol.}

\item{verbose}{integer level of verbosity. Zero means silent, higher values
make the output progressively more and more verbose.}

\item{indent}{indentation for diagnostic messages. Zero means no
indentation, each unit adds two spaces.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:

\item{powerEstimate}{ estimate of an appropriate soft-thresholding power:
the lowest power for which the scale free topology fit \eqn{R^2} exceeds
\code{RsquaredCut}. If \eqn{R^2} is below \code{RsquaredCut} for all powers,
\code{NA} is returned. }

\item{fitIndices}{ a data frame containing the fit indices for scale free
topology. The columns contain the soft-thresholding power, adjusted
\eqn{R^2} for the linear fit, the linear coefficient, adjusted \eqn{R^2} for
a more complicated fit models, mean connectivity, median connectivity and
maximum connectivity. If input \code{moreNetworkConcepts} is \code{TRUE}, 3
additional columns containing network density, centralization, and
heterogeneity.}
}
\description{
Analysis of scale free topology for multiple soft thresholding powers. The
aim is to help the user pick an appropriate soft-thresholding power for
network construction.
}
\details{
The function calculates weighted networks either by interpreting \code{data}
directly as similarity, or first transforming it to similarity of the type
specified by \code{networkType}. The weighted networks are obtained by
raising the similarity to the powers given in \code{powerVector}.  For each
power the scale free topology fit index is calculated and returned along
with other information on connectivity.

On systems with multiple cores or processors, the function pickSoftThreshold
takes advantage of parallel processing if the function
\code{\link{enableWGCNAThreads}} has been called to allow parallel
processing and set up the parallel calculation back-end.
