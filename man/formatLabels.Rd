\title{Break long character strings into multiple lines}
\usage{
formatLabels(labels, maxCharPerLine = 14, split = " ", fixed = TRUE,
  newsplit = split, keepSplitAtEOL = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{labels}{Character strings to be formatted.}

\item{maxCharPerLine}{Integer giving the maximum number of characters per
line.}

\item{split}{Pattern to be replaced by newline (\code{'\n'}) characters.}

\item{fixed}{Logical: Should the pattern be interpreted literally
(\code{TRUE}) or as a regular expression (\code{FALSE})? See
\code{\link{strsplit}} and its argument \code{fixed}.}

\item{newsplit}{Character string to replace the occurrences of \code{split}
above with.}

\item{keepSplitAtEOL}{When replacing an occurrence of \code{split} with a
newline character, should the \code{newsplit} be added before the newline as
well?}
}
\value{
A character vector of the same length as input \code{labels}.
}
\description{
This function attempts to break lomg character strings into multiple lines
by replacing a given pattern by a newline character.
}
\details{
Each given element of \code{labels} is processed independently. The
character string is split using \code{strsplit}, with \code{split} as the
splitting pattern. The resulting shorter character strings are then
concatenated together with \code{newsplit} as the separator. Whenever the
length of the combined result from the start or the previous newline
character exceeds \code{maxCharPerLine}, a newline character is inserted (at
the previous split).

Note that individual segements (i.e., sections of the input between
occurrences of \code{split}) whose number of characters exceeds
\code{maxCharPerLine} will not be split.
