\usage{
plotNetworkHeatmap(datExpr, plotGenes, useTOM = TRUE, power = 6,
  networkType = "unsigned", main = "Heatmap of the network")
}
\arguments{
\item{datExpr}{a data frame containing expression data, with rows
corresponding to samples and columns to genes. Missing values are allowed
and will be ignored.}

\item{plotGenes}{a character vector giving the names of genes to be included
in the plot. The names will be matched against \code{names(datExpr)}.}

\item{useTOM}{logical: should TOM be plotted (\code{TRUE}), or
correlation-based adjacency (\code{FALSE})?}

\item{power}{soft-thresholding power for network construction.}

\item{networkType}{a character string giving the newtork type. Recognized
values are (unique abbreviations of) \code{"unsigned"}, \code{"signed"}, and
\code{"signed hybrid"}.}

\item{main}{main title for the plot.}
}
\value{
None.
}
\description{
Network heatmap plot.
}
\details{
The function constructs a network from the given expression data (selected
by \code{plotGenes}) using the soft-thresholding procedure, optionally
calculates Topological Overlap (TOM) and plots a heatmap of the network.

Note that all network calculations are done in one block and may fail due to
memory allocation issues for large numbers of genes.
