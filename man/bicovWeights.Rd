\title{Weights used in biweight midcovariance}
\usage{
bicovWeights(x, pearsonFallback = TRUE, maxPOutliers = 1,
  outlierReferenceWeight = 0.5625, defaultWeight = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector or a two-dimensional array (matrix or data frame).  If
two-dimensional, the weights will be calculated separately on each column.}

\item{pearsonFallback}{Logical: if the median absolute deviation is zero,
should standard deviation be substituted?}

\item{maxPOutliers}{Optional specification of the maximum proportion of
outliers, i.e., data with weights equal to \code{outlierReferenceWeight}
below.}

\item{outlierReferenceWeight}{A number between 0 and 1 specifying what is to
be considered an outlier when calculating the proportion of outliers.}

\item{defaultWeight}{Value used for weights that correspond to a finite
\code{x} but the weights themselves would not be finite, for example, when a
column in \code{x} is constant.}
}
\value{
A vector or matrix of the same dimensions as the input \code{x}
giving the weights.
}
\description{
The function calculates weights used in the calculation of biweight
midcovariance and midcorrelation. The weights are designed such that
outliers get smaller weights; the weights become zero for data points more
than 9 median absolute deviations from the median.
}
\examples{

x = rnorm(100)
x[1] = 10
plot(x, bicovWeights(x))
