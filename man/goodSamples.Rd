\title{Filter samples with too many missing entries}
\usage{
goodSamples(datExpr, useSamples = NULL, useGenes = NULL,
  minFraction = 1/2, minNSamples = ..minNSamples, minNGenes = ..minNGenes,
  verbose = 1, indent = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{datExpr}{expression data. A data frame in which columns are genes and
rows ar samples.}

\item{useSamples}{optional specifications of which samples to use for the
check. Should be a logical vector; samples whose entries are \code{FALSE}
will be ignored for the missing value counts. Defaults to using all samples.}

\item{useGenes}{optional specifications of genes for which to perform the
check. Should be a logical vector; genes whose entries are \code{FALSE} will
be ignored. Defaults to using all genes.}

\item{minFraction}{minimum fraction of non-missing samples for a gene to be
considered good.}

\item{minNSamples}{minimum number of good samples for the data set to be
considered fit for analysis. If the actual number of good samples falls
below this threshold, an error will be issued.}

\item{minNGenes}{minimum number of non-missing samples for a sample to be
considered good.}

\item{verbose}{integer level of verbosity. Zero means silent, higher values
make the output progressively more and more verbose.}

\item{indent}{indentation for diagnostic messages. Zero means no
indentation, each unit adds two spaces.}
}
\value{
A logical vector with one entry per sample that is \code{TRUE} if
the sample is considered good and \code{FALSE} otherwise. Note that all
samples excluded by \code{useSamples} are automatically assigned
\code{FALSE}.
}
\description{
This function checks data for missing entries and returns a list of samples
that pass two criteria on maximum number of missing values: the fraction of
missing values must be below a given threshold and the total number of
missing genes must be below a given threshold.
}
\details{
The constants \code{..minNSamples} and \code{..minNGenes} are both set to
the value 4.  For most data sets, the fraction of missing samples criterion
will be much more stringent than the absolute number of missing samples
criterion.
