\title{Fast calculations of Pearson correlation.}
\usage{
cor(x, y = NULL, use = "all.obs", method = c("pearson", "kendall",
  "spearman"), quick = 0, cosine = FALSE, cosineX = cosine,
  cosineY = cosine, drop = FALSE, nThreads = 0, verbose = 0,
  indent = 0)

cor1(x, use = "all.obs", verbose = 0, indent = 0)

corFast(x, y = NULL, use = "all.obs", quick = 0, nThreads = 0,
  verbose = 0, indent = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric vector or a matrix. If \code{y} is null, \code{x} must be
a matrix.}

\item{y}{a numeric vector or a matrix. If not given, correlations of columns
of \code{x} will be calculated.}

\item{use}{a character string specifying the handling of missing data. The
fast calculations currently support \code{"all.obs"} and
\code{"pairwise.complete.obs"}; for other options, see R's standard
correlation function \code{\link[stats]{cor}}.  Abbreviations are allowed.}

\item{method}{a character string specifying the method to be used. Fast
calculations are currently available only for \code{"pearson"}.}

\item{quick}{real number between 0 and 1 that controls the precision of
handling of missing data in the calculation of correlations. See details.}

\item{cosine}{logical: calculate cosine correlation? Only valid for
\code{method="pearson"}. Cosine correlation is similar to Pearson
correlation but the mean subtraction is not performed. The result is the
cosine of the angle(s) between (the columns of) \code{x} and \code{y}.}

\item{cosineX}{logical: use the cosine calculation for \code{x}? This
setting does not affect \code{y} and can be used to give a hybrid
cosine-standard correlation.}

\item{cosineY}{logical: use the cosine calculation for \code{y}? This
setting does not affect \code{x} and can be used to give a hybrid
cosine-standard correlation.}

\item{drop}{logical: should the result be turned into a vector if it is
effectively one-dimensional?}

\item{nThreads}{non-negative integer specifying the number of parallel
threads to be used by certain parts of correlation calculations. This option
only has an effect on systems on which a POSIX thread library is available
(which currently includes Linux and Mac OSX, but excludes Windows). If zero,
the number of online processors will be used if it can be determined
dynamically, otherwise correlation calculations will use 2 threads.}

\item{verbose}{Controls the level of verbosity. Values above zero will cause
a small amount of diagnostic messages to be printed.}

\item{indent}{Indentation of printed diagnostic messages. Each unit above
zero adds two spaces.}
}
\value{
The matrix of the Pearson correlations of the columns of \code{x}
with columns of \code{y} if \code{y} is given, and the correlations of the
columns of \code{x} if \code{y} is not given.
}
\description{
These functions implements a faster calculation of Pearson correlation.
}
\details{
The speedup against the R's standard \code{\link[stats]{cor}} function will
be substantial particularly if the input matrix only contains a small number
of missing data. If there are no missing data, or the missing data are
numerous, the speedup will be smaller but still present.

The fast calculations are currently implemented only for
\code{method="pearson"} and \code{use} either \code{"all.obs"} or
\code{"pairwise.complete.obs"}.  The \code{corFast} function is a wrapper
that calls the function \code{cor}. If the combination of \code{method} and
\code{use} is implemented by the fast calculations, the fast code is
executed; otherwise, R's own correlation \code{\link[stats]{cor}} is
executed.

The argument \code{quick} specifies the precision of handling of missing
data. Zero will cause all calculations to be executed precisely, which may
be significantly slower than calculations without missing data.
Progressively higher values will speed up the calculations but introduce
progressively larger errors. Without missing data, all column means and
variances can be pre-calculated before the covariances are calculated. When
missing data are present, exact calculations require the column means and
variances to be calculated for each covariance. The approximate calculation
uses the pre-calculated mean and variance and simply ignores missing data in
the covariance calculation. If the number of missing data is high, the
pre-calculated means and variances may be very different from the actual
ones, thus potentially introducing large errors.  The \code{quick} value
times the number of rows specifies the maximum difference in the number of
missing entries for mean and variance calculations on the one hand and
covariance on the other hand that will be tolerated before a recalculation
is triggered. The hope is that if only a few missing data are treated
approximately, the error introduced will be small but the potential speedup
can be significant.
}
\note{
The implementation uses the BLAS library matrix multiplication
function for the most expensive step of the calculation. Using a tuned,
architecture-specific BLAS may significantly improve the performance of this
function.

The values returned by the corFast function may differ from the values
returned by R's function \code{\link[stats]{cor}} by rounding errors on the
order of 1e-15.

\examples{


## Test the speedup compared to standard function cor

# Generate a random matrix with 200 rows and 1000 columns

set.seed(10)
nrow = 100
ncol = 500
data = matrix(rnorm(nrow*ncol), nrow, ncol)

## First test: no missing data

system.time( {corStd = stats::cor(data)} )
system.time( {corFast = cor(data)} )

all.equal(corStd, corFast)

# Here R's standard correlation performs very well.

# We now add a few missing entries.

data[sample(nrow, 10), 1] = NA

# And test the correlations again...

system.time( {corStd = stats::cor(data, use ='p')} )

system.time( {corFast = cor(data, use = 'p')} )

all.equal(corStd, corFast)

# Here the R's standard correlation slows down considerably
# while corFast still retains it speed. Choosing
# higher ncol above will make the difference more pronounced.
