  nRuns, startRunIndex = 1, endRunIndex = startRunIndex + nRuns - 1,
  replace = FALSE, fraction = if (replace) 1 else 0.63,

\arguments{
\item{multiExpr}{Expression data in the multi-set format (see
\code{\link{checkSets}}). A vector of lists, one per set. Each set must
contain a component \code{data} that contains the expression data, with rows
corresponding to samples and columns to genes or probes.}

\item{networkOptions}{A single list of class \code{\link{NetworkOptions}}
giving options for network calculation for all of the networks, or a
\code{\link{multiSet}} structure containing one such list for each input
data set.}

\item{consensusTree}{A list specifying the consensus calculation. See
details.}

\item{nRuns}{Number of network construction and module identification runs.}

\item{startRunIndex}{Number to be assigned to the start run. The run number
or index is used to make saved files unique; it has no effect on the actual
results of the run.}

\item{endRunIndex}{Number (index) of the last run. If given, \code{nRuns} is
ignored.}

\item{replace}{Logical: should samples (observations or rows in entries in
\code{multiExpr}) be sampled with replacement?}

\item{fraction}{Fraction of samples to sample for each run.}

\item{randomSeed}{Integer specifying the random seed. If non-NULL, the
random number generator state is saved before the seed is set and restored
at the end of the function. If \code{NULL}, the random number generator
state is not changed nor saved at the start, and not restored at the end.}

\item{checkSoftPower}{Logical: should the soft-tresholding power be adjusted
to approximately match the connectivity distribution of the sampled data set
and the full data set?}

\item{nPowerCheckSamples}{Number of genes to be sampled from the full data
set to calculate connectivity and match soft-tresholding powers.}

\item{individualTOMFileNames}{Pattern for file names for files holding
individual TOMs. The tags \code{\%r, \%a, \%b} are replaced by run number,
analysis name and block number, respectively. The TOM files are usually
temporary but can be retained, see \code{keepConsensusTOM} below.}

\item{keepConsensusTOMs}{Logical: should the (final) consensus TOMs of each
sampled calculation be retained after the run ends? Note that for large data
sets (tens of thousands of nodes) the TOM files are rather large.}

\item{consensusTOMFilePattern}{Patter of the file to be stored}

\item{skipUnsampledCalculation}{Logical: should a calculation on original
(not resampled) data be skipped?}

\item{\dots}{Other arguments to \code{\link{hierarchicalConsensusModules}}.}

\item{verbose}{integer level of verbosity. Zero means silent, higher values
make the output progressively more and more verbose.}

\item{indent}{indentation for diagnostic messages. Zero means no
indentation, each unit adds two spaces.}

\item{saveRunningResults}{Logical: should the cumulative results be saved
after each run on resampled data?}

\item{runningResultsFile}{File name of file in which to save running results
into. In case of a parallel execution (say on several nodes of a cluster),
one should choose a unique name for each process to avoid overwriting the
same file.}
}
\value{
A list with one component per run. Each component is a list with the
following components: \item{mods}{The output of the function
\code{\link{hierarchicalConsensusModules}} on the resampled data.}
\item{samples}{Indices of the samples selected for the resampled data step
for this run.} \item{powers}{Actual soft-thresholding powers used in this
run.}
}
\description{
This function repeatedly resamples the samples (rows) in supplied data and
identifies hierarchical consensus modules on the resampled data.
}
\details{
For each run, samples (but not genes) are randomly sampled to obtain a
perturbed data set; a full network analysis and module identification is
carried out, and the results are returned in a list with one component per
run.

For each run, the soft-thresholding power can optionally be adjusted such
that the mean adjacency in the re-sampled data set equals the mean adjacency
in the original data.
