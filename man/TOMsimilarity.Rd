\usage{
TOMsimilarity(adjMat, TOMType = "unsigned", TOMDenom = "min", verbose = 1,
  indent = 0)

TOMdist(adjMat, TOMType = "unsigned", TOMDenom = "min", verbose = 1,
  indent = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{adjMat}{adjacency matrix, that is a square, symmetric matrix with
entries between 0 and 1 (negative values are allowed if
\code{TOMType=="signed"}).}

\item{TOMType}{a character string specifying TOM type to be calculated. One
of \code{"unsigned"}, \code{"signed"}. If \code{"unsigned"}, the standard
TOM will be used (more generally, TOM function will receive the adjacency as
input). If \code{"signed"}, TOM will keep track of the sign of the adjacency
between neighbors.}

\item{TOMDenom}{a character string specifying the TOM variant to be used.
Recognized values are \code{"min"} giving the standard TOM described in
Zhang and Horvath (2005), and \code{"mean"} in which the \code{min} function
in the denominator is replaced by \code{mean}. The \code{"mean"} may produce
better results but at this time should be considered experimental.}

\item{verbose}{integer level of verbosity. Zero means silent, higher values
make the output progressively more and more verbose.}

\item{indent}{indentation for diagnostic messages. Zero means no
indentation, each unit adds two spaces.}
}
\value{
A matrix holding the topological overlap.
}
\description{
Calculation of the topological overlap matrix from a given adjacency matrix.
}
\details{
The functions perform basically the same calculations of topological
overlap. \code{TOMdist} turns the overlap (which is a measure of similarity)
into a measure of dissimilarity by subtracting it from 1.

Basic checks on the adjacency matrix are performed and missing entries are
replaced by zeros.  If \code{TOMType = "unsigned"}, entries of the adjacency
matrix are required to lie between 0 and 1; for \code{TOMType = "signed"}
they can be between -1 and 1. In both cases the resulting TOM entries, as
well as the corresponding dissimilarities, lie between 0 and 1.

The underlying C code assumes that the diagonal of the adjacency matrix
equals 1. If this is not the case, the diagonal of the input is set to 1
before the calculation begins.
