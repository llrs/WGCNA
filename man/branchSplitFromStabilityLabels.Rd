stability study}
\usage{
branchSplitFromStabilityLabels(branch1, branch2, stabilityLabels,
  ignoreLabels = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{branch1}{A vector of indices giving members of branch 1.}

\item{branch2}{A vector of indices giving members of branch 1.}

\item{stabilityLabels}{A matrix of cluster labels. Each column corresponds
to one clustering and each row to one object (whose indices \code{branch1}
and \code{branch2} refer to).}

\item{ignoreLabels}{Label or labels that do not constitute proper clusters
in \code{stabilityLabels}, for example because they label unassigned
objects.}

\item{\dots}{Ignored.}
}
\value{
Branch dissimilarity (a single number between 0 and 1).

\description{
This function evaluates how different two branches are based on a series of
cluster labels that are usually obtained in a stability study but can in
principle be arbitrary. The idea is to quantify how well membership on the
two tested branches can be predicted from clusters in the given stability
labels.
}
\details{
The idea is to measure how well clusters in \code{stabilityLabels} can
distinguish the two given branches. For example, if a cluster C intersects
with branch1 but not branch2, it can distinguish branches 1 and 2 perfectly.
On the other hand, if there is a cluster C that contains both branch 1 and
branch 2, the two branches are indistinguishable (based on the test
clustering).

Formally, for each cluster C in each clustering in \code{stabilityLabels},
its contribution to the branch similarity is min(r1, r2), where r1 =
|intersect(C, branch1)|/|branch1| and r2 = |intersect(C,
branch2)|/|branch2|. The statistics for clusters in each clustering are
added; the sums are then averaged across the clusterings. Since the result
is a similarity statistic, the final dissimilarity is defined as
1-similarity. The dissimilarity ranges between 0 (branch1 and branch2 are
indistinguishable) and 1 (branch1 and branch2 are perfectly
distinguishable).

This is a very simple statistic that does not attempt to correct for the
similarity that would be expected by chance.
